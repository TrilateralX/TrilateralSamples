Notes

- haxe_webgl.fill - not filling see original? https://github.com/TrilateralX/TrilateralFill

- Heaps currently Stack overflow, original working..
  I think it's just too slow I need some guidence on setting up shaders in Heaps.

- NME examples not working, think nightlies are not really stable against latest haxe.

- Gluon works on cpp :)

- Lime WebGL works 

- Canvas should work just need to reuse from old project maybe not worth it.

- OpenFL works very slow on c++ or js - impractical.

- Kha shoul work just need to reuse from old project and wait for new release of Kha with haxe4.2
