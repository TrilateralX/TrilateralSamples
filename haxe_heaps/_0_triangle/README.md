# TrilateralHeapsSVG
Test of setup of heaps and trilateral3

REQUIRES HAXE 4.2 and git heaps, you may need to change '\_\_js\_\_' manually in heaps for 'js.code.Syntax'

First make sure you have the dependancies, see [dependancyInstall.hxml](https://github.com/TrilateralX/TrilateralHeapsSVG/blob/master/dependancyInstall.hxml)

The approach does need improving but it shows feasibility at least.
